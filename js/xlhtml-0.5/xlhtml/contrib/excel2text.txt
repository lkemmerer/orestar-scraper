To enable Mutt to display Excel attachments, follow these steps.

1.  Make sure the following programs are in a directory in your PATH:
	excel2text
	xlhtml
	w3m	<http://ei5nazha.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/~aito/w3m/eng/>

2.  Add these lines to Mutt's mailcap file:

	application/excel;		excel2text %s; copiousoutput
	application/ms-Excel;		excel2text %s; copiousoutput
	application/msexcel;		excel2text %s; copiousoutput
	application/vnd.ms-excel;	excel2text %s; copiousoutput
	application/x-excel;		excel2text %s; copiousoutput
	application/x-msexcel;		excel2text %s; copiousoutput

3.  To have Mutt automatically expand Excel attachments in-line, in
    addition to being able to view the attachments from the attachments
    menu, add these lines to Mutt's configuration file (e.g.,
    ~/.muttrc):

	auto_view application/excel application/ms-Excel
	auto_view application/msexcel application/vnd.ms-excel
	auto_view application/x-excel application/x-msexcel
