uploader.pl is a cgi-bin wrapper that allows a server with xlhtml
to convert xls files via the Netscape Upload form. Note: there is a 
file size limit of 128K. Here's the steps to get it working on Apache:

1) With a editor, go to line 45 and correct the path to the xlhtml
   executable on your system. You can use 'which xlhtml' if you don't know.
   Also, line 1 may need changing depending on where perl is on your system.
2) Copy the file uploader to /home/httpd/cgi-bin
3) cd /home/httpd/cgi-bin
4) chmod +x uploader.pl from the cgi-bin directory
5) In the cgi-bin directory mkdir tempdata
6) chmod 0007 tempdata
7) In Netscape, type: http://localhost/cgi-bin/uploader.pl   and press Enter.
   If it is setup correctly, you should have a form and then you can
   select Test.xls if you don't have one and try it.



enjoy
