HIGH PRIORITY:
**************

* Review all the documentation for style errors and so on.
  PLEASE, ENGLISH SPEAKERS, HELP ME HERE!!!

* Improve example of cole_recurse_tree() in examples/filesystem.c: include
  actual callback functions, not just NULLs.

* Write tests for all calls of the API: Improve example/directory.c:
  missing some calls to test.

* Call all the calls of the API in examples/demo.c.

* Implement more API calls, like `stdio.h' ANSI C calls.

* Search for `FIXME' in the source code... and fix some =).


MEDIUM:
*******

* Improve tests, they must actually test the output of the public calls.

* Investigate if it is possible to use `const' in static version variables.

* Test cole_fopen() using wired filenames. ie "/", "//", "", etc. May be a
  function that check the filename could be written.

* Check input arguments of each call of the API, returning an colerror if
  there are an error.

* Say in the documentation that many other files can be `Structured Storage'
  files too.

* May be in cole 3.x, create a double char type in order to handle the complete
  directory and file names.

* Investigate how to avoid content of the structures COLEFILE and so on be
  documented in the api document (their must be documented only in the internal
  document).

* Investigate how to force that calls begining with `_' to be in documentation
  (their will be in internals).

* Make api section is before internals section in generated documentation, but
  COLEFS, COLEFILE, COLEDIR and COLEDIRENT must be documented in internals, not
  in api.

* Make cole fork safe.

* Make reentrant safe.

* Review Martin Schwartz mail:
  ---QUOTE---
  It might be helpful to you to have a look at the perl 5 (Ole::Storage) 
  release file "Storage.pm" method "ole_head", giving some additional info
  about big- and smallblocksize (offset 0x1e, 0x20) as well as about Extended 
  Block Depot for very large files (offset 0x44, 0x48). And, sorry for my
  screwed up namegiving...
  ---END QUOTE---
  The Extended Block Depot is implemented now, but bigblocksize and
  smallblocksize are not implented yet.

* Really use the results of the configure guesses, with #ifdef HAVE_x in code.

* Make it compile using DJGPP and Borland C (we may need a custom Makefile and
  a custom config.h).

* Use void `swab(const void *from, void *to, size_t n);' (in fil_sread*
  calls) if present, for performance, in support.c.

* Replace cole_direntry_getday[12] and cole_direntry_getsec[12] calls with
  another calls that return something useful.

* Divide the RPM in cole and cole-devel packages (may be it's not necessary,
  because cole package is not much big).



NOT URGENT:
***********

* Use some package to discover uninitializated memory, use some profile
  package, etc.

* Use zlib to support compressed files.
