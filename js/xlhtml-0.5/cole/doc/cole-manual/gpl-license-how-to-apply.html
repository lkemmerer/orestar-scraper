possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
      </P

>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
